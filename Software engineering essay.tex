\abstract{This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using behavior trees for managing simple NPC character AI behavior. First there will be an introduction of behavior trees, what the main structural features are and what they do, also how a game engine would run the behavior tree, using diagrams as examples and help explain some features. The paper then names the advantages and disadvantages of using behavior trees for AI character behavior.}

\section{Introduction}

One of the deciding factors on how well a game is rated is the behavior of the NPC characters AI within the game, their movement and senses have to be realistic\cite{dey2013ql}, e.g. if the NPC enemy is supposed to detect the player with sight, it would be wrong for the player to be detected through a wall. Therefore programming an NPC character is one of the most important parts of producing a game\cite{buckland2005programming} and should be simplified as much as possible, unfortunately there are many different ways to programme an AI controlled character, of which behavior trees is one of the most recent methods\cite{GDCVault}, this paper will look into the advantages and disadvantages of simple NPC character programming using behavior trees. The conclusion will discuss whether other AI behavior programming methods would have less disadvantages for example visual node-based scripting language.

\section{What are behaviour trees?}

Rahul Dey and Chris Child state that behavior trees (BT) were created as a more intuitive revision of a finite state machine\cite{dey2013ql}, a brief description of a final state machine is a number of states that require an input to transition to another state which may result in an output or action\cite{buckland2005programming}. The behavior tree has 5 main node types\cite{gamasutra} (depending what engine the BT is built in there could be many structural components); leaves, branches, composite, decorator and root.
A BT starts with a root, it has no parent which means there is nothing before the root, and it gets called when the NPC first spawns and when a behaviour has ended which starts the BT loop over.
Leaves are the actual actions or behavior that the NPC exhibits in game they have no child which means after their action is completed the BT is started at the root again\cite{marzinotto2014towards}.

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. The conclusion should do more than summarise the essay, making clear the contribution of the work and highlighting key points, limitations, and outstanding questions. It should not introduce any new content or information. \cite{youtube} \cite{UE4} \cite{nicolau2016evolutionary} \cite{nareyek2004ai}
