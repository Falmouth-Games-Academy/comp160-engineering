# Engineering for portability.

## What must be considered during a portable game's development?

A game's portability is a reference to the hardware and software abstractions that have facilitated the ability to play a game on different hardware and on different operating systems.

Economically it is obvious that a developer would want to have the largest market possible, but how is this achieved and at what cost?

A game created with a game engine using assets that are usable by differing machines with different qualities can easily be limited by the weakest components.  At it's extreme consider the differences between a modern online multiplayer game running on a high end pc, and the same game on a smartphone.  The differences would be obvious considering the vastly different memory and processing power of each when trying to run the many difficult computations needed. However, even were they to have the same internal hardware, the same operating system and software, consideration must be given to the size of the screen, the quality of the sound, the controllers, and the target market - were a convincing port possible, would it sell?

I will research successes and failures of ported games and look into what alternatives are available.
