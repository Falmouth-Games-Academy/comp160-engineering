# COMP160 Software Engineering Essay
Essay on the Software Engineering

Please note, your research questions should focus on *ONE* of these themes:

* Engineering for Accessibility
* Engineering for Portability
* Engineering for Localisation
* Specialist Algorithms and their Integration into Game Architectures

Please ensure that you reference appropirate academic literature and ensure that the discussion incorporates appropriate reference to key engineering principles and practices. Apply what you have learned into your collaborative game.

* "After the identification of auditory signs, we grouped those with similar properties into classes that represented what features of the sound effects were used to convey information, like volume, timbre etc. We also identified how the classes of sound features were used to communicate and grouped them into strategies. These classes and strategies are listed on the sidebar on the next page."

* "The focus of our research was the impact of the use of audio in FPS games for hearing impaired users. Thus, in order to select the games to be inspected we took into consideration whether they offered audio, as well as other representations, such as closed captions or visual redundancies, that would allow hearing impaired users to play the game."

* "The classes represent the existent types of audio signs in FPS games. The strategies on the other hand, describe how the classes are used to convey information in the game."

* Provides list of guidelines for when evaluating deaf children:

1. Organize the test session in public spaces, e.g., schools.
2. Tests should be carried out with a group of children.
3. No more than thirty minutes long.
4. No parents present.
5. Provide instructions both orally and with sign language.
6. If written instruction are necessary, pay attention to the
 language used
 After giving instructions to the child, ask her/him to
 repeat them (deaf children often say to have understood
 even if it is not, they teachers affirm).
8. At the end of the test, ask children about their
 impressions.
