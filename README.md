# COMP160 Software Engineering Essay
Essay on the Software Engineering

Please note, your research questions should focus on *ONE* of these themes:

* Engineering for Accessibility
* Engineering for Portability
* __Engineering for Localisation__
* Specialist Algorithms and their Integration into Game Architectures

Please ensure that you reference appropirate academic literature and ensure that the discussion incorporates appropriate reference to key engineering principles and practices. Apply what you have learned into your collaborative game.


# Question: 
In the modern day almost all software is localised for a variety of languages as it allows the software to be used by a much wider audience. However there are a lot of problems that can occur when doing this as there are, of course, a set of standards that must be followed if the application is to be successful. With this in mind I would like to base my paper around the problems and key challenges faced when looking at localising software and how it can be done whilst keeping 100% of the functionality available to all users. If this is thought about during the whole engineering process then I would expect it to be reletivley easy to perform.

__What are the key challeneges faced when localising software while abiding to the standards set by LISA (Localization Industry Standards Association), and how can we work to overcome them?__

__During the software development process what precautions can we think about for when it comes to localising our software?__
