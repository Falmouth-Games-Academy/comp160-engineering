## Portability
Software portability has been an ongoing issue for years now. Developers face the challenge of having to make software portable so it can be used on many machines, this enables them to get a bigger market of customers. Software is classed as portable if it costs less money to port if from one operating system to another than if it less than having to rewrite the entire program for that OS. However there are many problems faced with this, a big one is when using game engines is they require the logic to be formatted properly for the format of that engine. If this was broken down so the logic was split from the rest of the engine the code would be easily ported from one engine to another. Anothe big issue which I will look at is the different hardware available when porting and how to get it so the program manages to run the same on both machines. I'm going to look at the main ways devlopers make their software portable and discuss my views on ways people have tried to solve the issues and suggest my own ways in which software can be made portable.
