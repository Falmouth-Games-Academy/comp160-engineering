## How game code and logic can be made more portable
I my essay I plan to talk about how game logic and code can be more easily ported to other platforms which will result in more cost effective portability of games to multiple different platforms. One issue with many game engines (e.g. Unreal) is that they require the logic to be formatted in their proprietary format, usually some form of script language. This can be an issue since the logic is the core of the game. It would be better and more practical if the logic was separate from the rest of the system and could be easily carried over to another system. This would increase logic reusability as the logic could be migrated to another engine without having to rewrite it in the format for that engine.
In my essay I will discuss the feasibility of separating out the logic by representing it using ontologies and rules, and by introducing middleware (an events space) between the logic and the game engine.
