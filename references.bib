abstract={Video games are becoming less and less usable by people with disabilities every day. These disabilities include cognitive, visual, and mobility. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the necessity of making video games accessible. This will be done through looking at benefits, current work for all disabilities, and how it's looked at by the law. The topic of video gaming accessibility is especially important in today's age with the disabled population rising. It is important to not let the disabled be left out of the enjoyment of video games.},

year={2011}, 
pages={206-210}, 
abstract={Nowadays technology has lead to the realization of high technology videogame consoles supporting very complex and realistic games in terms of graphics, fluidity, near real-like behaviour. Console controllers (joypads) are sophisticated, too, providing several controls like pushbuttons and joysticks. For people with motor impairments, operating such controllers is often difficult or impossible, due to small size and reduced spacing of controls and their arrangement. More over, action games, very popular among young people, also require quick response times. As an overall result, for people with upper limb motor impairments and cognitive disabilities, a barrier exist for accessing videogames. In this paper we propose an interface device allowing upper limb and mild cognitive impaired users to play with a popular video game console, adding beside the original controller a man-machine interface able to manage commercial switch interfaces normally used by disabled people to access and control electronic equipments. The proposed device allows for both autonomous and cooperative game. By means of a very easy and quick procedure, the device allows the mapping of up to nine joypad controls to external switch sensors, turning suitable for many different games, and allowing assignment of game functions to users according to their potential. The device is now available on the market.},

abstract={Web accessibility/mobile app accessibility for the disabled has been studied for the past 10 years. The legislation of web accessibility guidelines can guarantee easy access to web contents of the disabled but not game playing, because web/ mobile app contents consists of rather simple information compared with game contents. Game contents include many PCs (player characters)/NPCs (non PCs) and the conflicts among them, as well as upgrade of a player character by completion of a quest in competition. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and classify game accessibility so as to make the game accessibility guidelines.},

year={2016}, 
pages={1-8}, 
abstract={With increasingly attention to the digital gaming industry in entertainment, games have become more graphical, solidifying the visual modality. In this reality, visually impaired people have little participation in the market and lose all the culture involved in this industry. Across the planet 246 million people have low vision and 39 million are blind. In Brazil there are 6 million people with low vision and 582,000 blind, almost all excluded from digital gaming. Analyzing gaming market for the blind and the adaptations of titles seeking their inclusion, this research aims to propose from the perspective of Information Science, the initial studies in order to help accessibility studies for the visually impaired using electronic games, treated as Assistive Technology with concepts of Multimodality. It intends to be a new approach for a theoretical work by analyzing accessibility guidelines for visually impaired people, which can serve as steps for interpreting these public demands in digital games development, aimed at the greater inclusion of them. This is still a theoretical work with a suggestion that there is a market for games developed for the visually impaired. Its conclusion is there is a lack of concern by developers to deploy best items in this area and there is a lack of opportunity by Brazilian government to promote such research and development. Researches made by organizations were observed and used as a basis for checking possibility of a better inclusion of the visually impaired.},

abstract={The physiotherapy and rehabilitation process is an expensive and time consuming affair. It also requires the direct supervision of the specialists for effective results. This high cost coupled with high demand prohibits many patients from receiving appropriate care. Moreover, the emotional and mental strain is excessive for patients and is counterproductive to the therapy. In this paper, we tackle the boredom aspect of the rehabilitation process wherein we develop a therapy system that uses computer games to emulate the therapeutic activities. We describe, in some details, the issues involved in the development process. Commercial of the shelf product is employed (the Xbox Kinect) so the cost is significantly reduced and the accessibility is greatly increased. The system was tested on children at a local hospital, and the feedback was highly encouraging. This work opens avenues for more research to be conducted in exercise development, movement emulation, and game design. Moreover, commercialization of these games is an interesting endeavor.},
