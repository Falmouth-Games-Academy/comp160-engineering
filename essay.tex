\abstract{Mobile phones are no common place within both homes and people’s pockets. Many people use them for work, games and communication. As such, many programs that have been created for these purposes on PC are being imported to mobile platforms. The mobile phone industry having such a large concentration on casual games means many games have been ported from PC and console versions to mobile. This essay aims to look at the problems, practices and general focus that companies have when they port a game from other consoles to mobile. Overall I wish to find out "How has the mobile games industry influenced profesional developers and their software practices, especially with regard to mobile games development.}

\section{Introduction}

How has the development in demand for mobile games affected the choices in which platforms developers make games on/port games to?
Mobile gaming has become a huge part of the gaming market. Globally smartphone gaming revenue accounts for €12.1 billion each year, in the US 67% of adults play games. So it is fair to say that mobile devices have become a large part of how people play and pay for games. How has this affected software developers though? Have they changed to focus more on this platform? Most importantly, how has this affected developers practices with regards to the portability of their software?


Write your introduction here. A brief introduction is recommended, which should outline key details of the chosen topic and the reviewed papers, motivate the work, and provide a roadmap of key points to the reader. The motivation is quite important here, as essays should have a contribution (i.e., what is the point of the essay, and what does the reader take away from the essay) and the link between the motivation (in the introduction) and the contribution (in the conclusion) should be made clear. \cite{sims_2016}

Software portability has come a long way in the last 20 years. However software portability has always been a huge issue in software development. "Engineers making use of computer-aided engineering and design (CAE/CAD) packages are often not aware of the problems faced by software houses implementing and supporting complex software across a range of computer systems and workstations." [4] This paper shows that there is much more to software portability than most software developers are aware. 

Portability to different systems often means learning new languages in order to comply to the new platforms regulations. There are hundreds of languages, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and difficulties to port from one system to another. 

Mobile software is constantly in demand as it has become such a large part of the everyday consumers needs and wants. Many games originally designed to run on PC's have been ported over to mobile platforms. Hearthstone was originally developed to run on PC but has since been implemented onto tablets and phones in a way which allows players on different devices to still play against each other.  The major problem the developers had was reviewing the interface interaction to still feel the same as using a mouse. 
More specifically there are problems developing software for certain platforms of mobile devices. Apple's IOS for example is restrictive on software developers, as it only allows for the user of objectiveC and swift. While Android is much more open about the languages allowed to be used on it, it is also known that certain languages have larger impacts on performance than others. Potentially the SDK used can also have large impacts on the software developed as well. 

Some are older games like GTA vice city, which have been given new interfaces which better fit touchscreens used on nearly all modern mobile devices. Overall porting the game was largely a success and has gained good reviews, although there were complaints that using the ipad interface poses some problems to user experience. 
Paragraph 5 – summary of problems with portability to mobile platforms
It seems that the largest problem of porting software to a mobile platform is changing the interface to give a user friendly experience, without letting the software become unfamiliar to the user.



Write the main body of your essay here. Add more sections if appropriate. You may choose to write about each of your three papers in its own section, or you may choose a different structure. Either way, remember that you are being assessed on technical insight and analysis: it is not enough to merely summarise the contents of the three papers. You must demonstrate the ability to make inferences beyond what is written in the papers, and to draw the three papers together into a single coherent narrative.


\section{Conclusion}

It seems that the largest problem of porting software to a mobile platform is changing the interface to give a user friendly experience, without letting the software become unfamiliar to the user.

Write your conclusion here. The conclusion should do more than summarise the essay, making clear the contribution of the work and highlighting key points, limitations, and outstanding questions. It should not introduce any new content or information.
