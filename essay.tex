\section{Introduction}

This paper will look at the key differences between the video game industry and websites, regarding accessibility. The video games industry is an ever expanding market, which has a huge audience at approximately 31.6 billion people within the UK alone. \cite{UKIE2017Games} Looking at the figures of usage on the internet and the volume at which it is used, along with the requirements which are enforced to make a a website valid. \cite{world2017internet} \cite{caldwell2008web} It's clear to see that the video games industry is growing rapidly but outside of many regulations which could potentially cause an a decline in independent game projects as implementing all these regulations could be well beyond the programmers skill level.

\section{Accessiblity for in Video Games}

It would be unfair to say however that all video games lack any kind of accessibility features, a very recent example is Nier Automata \cite{Platinum2017Nier}, which features an easy mode which allows users with lower mobility skills to still be able to play the game through the use of an automatic response system. It will automatically perform actions like dodging and attacking to a limited extent making the game much easier for people who can't react quickly to various prompts.
