\section{Introduction}

This paper will look at the key differences between the video game industry and websites, regarding accessibility. The video games industry is an ever expanding market, which has a huge audience at approximately 31.6 billion people within the UK alone. \cite{UKIE2017Games} Looking at the figures of usage on the internet and the volume at which it is used, along with the requirements which are enforced to make a a website valid. \cite{world2017internet} \cite{caldwell2008web} It's clear to see that the video games industry is growing rapidly but outside of many regulations which could potentially cause an a decline in independent game projects.

\section{Your section title here}

Write the main body of your essay here. Add more sections if appropriate. You may choose to write about each of your three papers in its own section, or you may choose a different structure. Either way, remember that you are being assessed on technical insight and analysis: it is not enough to merely summarise the contents of the three papers. You must demonstrate the ability to make inferences beyond what is written in the papers, and to draw the three papers together into a single coherent narrative.

Your essay must make a clear recommendation, in terms of which of the three techniques you have reviewed is the best according to whichever metric or metrics you feel is most appropriate. You must justify your choice, backing it up with empirical evidence. However remember that an academic essay is not a murder mystery: you should already have briefly discussed your recommendation in the introduction and in other parts of the essay. Do not save it for a grand reveal at the end.

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. The conclusion should do more than summarise the essay, making clear the contribution of the work and highlighting key points, limitations, and outstanding questions. It should not introduce any new content or information.
