\section{Introduction}
The implementation of new functionality to any exisitng system comes with complications. The one complication that the author wishes to focus on this essay is coupling. In the following essay, the author aims to provide insight on the difficulties of adding new procedural content generation(PCG) algorithms for the generation of maps. A description of problems that may arise from high interdependence will allow the reader to notice if any of these symptoms are apparent in anywork they have done or are doing.In the game industry, you may have to work on a game system designed by someone else. In these cases there may be little to no structure. By extrapolating research theory and case studies from the software engineering industry, the author will suggest stratergies to keep the integrety of your data when implementing the PCG algorithms.


Write your introduction here. A brief introduction is recommended, which should outline key details of the chosen topic and the reviewed papers, motivate the work, and provide a roadmap of key points to the reader. The motivation is quite important here, as essays should have a contribution (i.e., what is the point of the essay, and what does the reader take away from the essay) and the link between the motivation (in the introduction) and the contribution (in the conclusion) should be made clear.

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. The conclusion should do more than summarise the essay, making clear the contribution of the work and highlighting key points, limitations, and outstanding questions. It should not introduce any new content or information.
