\maketitle

\abstract{Localisation of software has the capacity to pose many a challenge to developers, as there are so many factors and small details that come into play, with a large portions of the software needing to be completely overhauled depending on the locale, a set of "Internationalisation Standards"\cite{hogan2004key} have to be followed by the developer if they want their software to be understandable and usable in the local they are adapting it for, this is applicable to both video games and other types of software and so my essay will compare and contrast the different steps that the developers of these types of software have to take.}

\section{Introduction}

% Write your introduction here. A brief introduction is recommended, which should outline key details of the chosen topic and the reviewed papers, motivate the work, and provide a roadmap of key points to the reader. The motivation is quite important here, as essays should have a contribution (i.e., what is the point of the essay, and what does the reader take away from the essay) and the link between the motivation (in the introduction) and the contribution (in the conclusion) should be made clear.

As technology's accessibility and uptake across the globe is forever increasing, many new emerging markets opportunities are opening up for software developers and having localised versions of their software allows for ``Local users better understand and use it, attract more users, and increase software sales''\cite{6601827}. As previously mentioned, developers have to work to a set of standards to make sure that their software is understandable to a variety of markets, and through my research I have found that, due to the differences in the engineering workflow of video games and other types of software, that different organisations and groups have created several different sets of standards for different types of software, and as games require a lot more context and speech to relay the story to the player, the workflow is a lot larger, however there are some points where they overlap and flow in a similar way. 

\section{Integral Differences}
As I have found through my research, compared to other types of software, video games have both a much higher amount of content, and require much more work to localise than other types of software e.g. Buisness, as ``The linguistic port is more than simple translation; it involves use of vernacular and dialect as well as culturally appropriate interpretation of the game context'' \cite{losavio2014linguistic} 

%as games are more complex and the story may have fictional elements, can't simply be translated, unlike buisness software which can be localised with a simple tool, cite paper about this. 


\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. The conclusion should do more than summarise the essay, making clear the contribution of the work and highlighting key points, limitations, and outstanding questions. It should not introduce any new content or information.
